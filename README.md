# Hue Controller
This project contains a web page the uses an `XMLHttpRequest` on your local network to send JSON data to the Hue Light. It does not require or use the Hue API.

## Set Up
A newdeveloper URL needs to be set up on the hue bridge before it can be controlled. For now, this is a hard coded string, but eventually it will be automated.

## Chrome App Dev Installation
Download a copy of the repository.
In Chrome, navigate to the extensions page [chrome://extensions/]
Drag and drop the www directory into the extensions page.

The Hue Controller will now be accessible from the start menu and from chrome://apps/

## Release
The project will be eventually be released in the Chrome Store.
